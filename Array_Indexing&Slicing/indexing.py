# A numpy array is a grid of values with the same type and is indexed by a tuple of non-negative values.
# Numpy arrays have the type of ndarray.
# Use the array() function to create a numpy array.
# Use the dtype property to get the data type of arrayâ€™s elements.
# Use the ndim property to get the number of dimensions or the number of axes.
# Use the shape property to get the number of dimensions as well as the number of elements in each dimension.
